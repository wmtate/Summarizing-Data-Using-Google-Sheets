# Welcome!

## Welcome to use Google Sheets to aggregate data. 
This is a project that takes approximately 2 hours to complete. Before starting the project, look at the objectives and structure. Manually summarizing large amounts of data into a few numbers, charts, and graphs to get valuable information hidden in them can seem tedious. In this project, our focus will be to show various graphical methods for aggregating data using Google Sheets. We will introduce you to the most commonly used methods in a business environment, while focusing on how to develop them and when they are most appropriate. We will use Google Sheets and a large data set to illustrate how to create a summary technique.

## Project Objectives
In this project, we are going to use Google Sheet to construct frequency tables, bar charts, including histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts to analyze your data across diferent fields, disciplines or industries.

## Project Structure
This Project using Google Sheets to summarize data is divided into the following tasks: 

 Task 1: Quantitative data from the frequency table of Google Sheets 
 
 Task 2: Qualitative data from the frequency table of Google Sheets 
 
 Task 3: Display the frequency table as a bar chart of Google Sheets
 
 Task 4: Histogram in Google Sheets 
 
 Task 5: Pie Chart in Google Sheets 
 
 Task 6: Scatter Plot in Google Sheets.

### Step 5: Aggregate data using Google Sheets 

* Understand the data
* Merge data
* Use a pivot table to summarize data
* Use custom formulas to summarize data
* Create graphs and charts

### Step 6: Answers, Insights, Findings and Summary
The quality assurance manager of the contact center is preparing a baseline report on key performance indicators. 
You want to customize the service level threshold based on the time (in seconds) that callers wait for their call to be answered.
